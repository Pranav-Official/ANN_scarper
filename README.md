Scrape news feed from anime news network

This is simple code in python to scrape titles and descripctions from the AnimeNewsNetwork.

This uses requests library and BeautifulSoup to get the html and parse it.
scarping is heavily depended on the html structure of the source page. Thus when the html structre changes or gets updated this program becomes obselete.


This is just a fun way that i found to test myself on web scraping. I do not own any content hosted on AnimeNewsNetwork.
